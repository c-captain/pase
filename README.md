# PASE

PASE: PostgreSQL Ultra-High Dimensional Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search Extension

**(PASE is currently under review by the companyâ€™s open source committee, and is believed to be completed soon. The code  would be added once approved.)**


## Introduction
PASE is the index extention  of PostgreSQL. So far two types of NNS algorithms are supported: quantization-based and graph-based. The other algorithms can be easily implemented under the proposed framework. Experiments have been conducted on large data sets to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed retrieval mechanism.

## Building

1. install psql
2. make USE_PGXS=1

## How Pase works

PASE can be used directly through the simple command 'create extention pase;' in PG. For specific usage examples, please refer to "sql/pase.sql".
